\section{Calculation of Gravity}
In this section, the gravity of Tehran is calculated with two methods.
\subsection{First Method}
In this method, the gravity is calculated with the following formula:
\begin{equation}
    g = g_0\dfrac{R_G^2}{(R_G+h)^2}
\end{equation}
where $g_0$ is calculated with the following formula:
\begin{equation}
    g_0 = 9.780327(1+0.0053024\sin^2(L)-0.0000058\sin^2(2L))
\end{equation}
and $R_G$ is the Guissian radius of the Earth.
Lattitude of Tehran is $35.6892$ and the Guissian radius of the Earth is $R_G = 6367.449$.
The gravity of Tehran is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
    g = 9.780327(1+0.0053024\sin^2(35.6892)-0.0000058\sin^2(2\times35.6892))\dfrac{6367.449^2}{(6367.449+1190)^2} = 9.806
\end{equation}
\subsection{Second Method}
% J2 gravity model
In this method, the gravity is calculated with the following formula:
\begin{equation}
    g = g_0(1+J_2\dfrac{R_E^2}{r^2}(1.5\sin^2\theta-0.5))
\end{equation}
The gravitational potential considering the \(J_2\) term is given by the formula:

\[
U(r, \theta, \lambda) = -\frac{GM}{r} \left[1 - J_2 \left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^2 \frac{3}{2} \left(1 - 5\sin^2\theta\right)\cos^2\lambda\right]
\]

Here:
\begin{align*}
& U(r, \theta, \lambda) \text{ is the gravitational potential}, \\
& G \text{ is the gravitational constant}, \\
& M \text{ is the mass of the Earth}, \\
& R \text{ is the Earth's mean radius}, \\
& r \text{ is the radial distance from the Earth's center}, \\
& \theta \text{ is the colatitude (90 degrees minus latitude)}, \\
& \lambda \text{ is the longitude}, \\
& J_2 \text{ is the second zonal harmonic coefficient}.
\end{align*}

Now, for Tehran, let's calculate \(J_2\) at its location. Tehran's approximate geodetic coordinates are \(35.6895^\circ\) N latitude and \(51.3890^\circ\) E longitude.

\begin{align*}
& \sin^2 \theta = \sin^2 (90^\circ - 35.6895^\circ) \approx 0.2551, \\
& \cos^2 \lambda = \cos^2(51.3890^\circ) \approx 0.3706.
\end{align*}

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[
J_2 \approx -\frac{C_2}{2} = -\frac{1}{2} \times 0.00108263 \approx -0.00054132
\]

Now, let's calculate the gravity at Tehran's location:

\[
g = g_0(1+J_2\dfrac{R_E^2}{r^2}(1.5\sin^2\theta-0.5)) = 9.780327(1-0.00054132\dfrac{6367.449^2}{(6367.449+1190)^2}(1.5\times0.2551-0.5)) = 9.806
\]
